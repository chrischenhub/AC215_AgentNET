How is this different from Context7?
- Context7 works by looking up a library and giving you the 10k most relevant tokens. If you have 2 libraries, that's 20k tokens etc. It's unlikely you need all of that and it's costly. Ref uses on average 60% fewer tokens and up to 95% fewer (eg 500 tokens instead of 10000) in some cases.
- Ref supports indexing private GitHub repos and PDFs so you can bring your own context as well.
